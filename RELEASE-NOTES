1. What is Apache Flume
Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available service for
efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log
data. It has a simple and flexible architecture based on streaming
data flows. It is robust and fault tolerant with tunable reliability
mechanisms and many failover and recovery mechanisms. The system is
centrally managed and allows for intelligent dynamic management. It
uses a simple extensible data model that allows for online analytic
application.

2. Status of this release
This release is the second release of Apache Flume within the Apache
Incubator, and is labelled and should be considered as a beta version.
As compared to the previous release, it has substantially more features
and functionality along with bug fixes and other enhancements. However
it is likely to change until a stable release version.
