h1. Welcome to Apache Flume!

Apache Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available service for efficiently
collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data. It has a simple
and flexible architecture based on streaming data flows. It is robust and fault
tolerant with tunable reliability mechanisms and many failover and recovery
mechanisms. The system is centrally managed and allows for intelligent dynamic
management. It uses a simple extensible data model that allows for online
analytic application.

The Flume-NG is refactoring of the first generation Flume to solve certain
known issues and limitations of the original design. This is considered a
preview release; bugs should be expected.

Apache Flume is open-sourced under the Apache Software Foundation License v2.0.
